# Rule-Based Chatbot (RuleBot)

![Chatbot Screenshot](screenshot.PNG)

A lightweight, interactive command-line chatbot built in Python. This project demonstrates basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts using rule-based pattern matching and input sanitization.

## Features
* **Pattern Matching:** Matches user inputs against predefined keywords.
* **Input Sanitization:** Automatically handles trailing spaces and letter casing (e.g., "Hello " or "HELLO" will both work).
* **Graceful Exit:** Recognizes multiple exit commands like `bye`, `exit`, `quit`, and `adios`.
* **Fallback System:** Gently guides users back on track if they enter an unrecognized command.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
